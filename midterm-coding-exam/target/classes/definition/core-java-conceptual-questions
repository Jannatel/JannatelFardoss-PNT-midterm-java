Explain the entire java life cycle.

- Life cycle of a java program tells us what happens right from the point when we type source code in a text editor to the point that source code is converted into machine code (0’s and 1’s).
There are three main stages in the life cycle of a java program. They are:

* Editing the program
*Compiling the source code
*Executing the byte code

First, you will start with typing the program in a text-editor (ex: notepad, notepad++, wordpad, textedit etc). After completing editing of the program,
we have to save the file.While saving the file you should remember that the file must be saved with .java extension. For example, let’s think that I
had written a Java program which contains a single class Sample (more on classes in future posts). It is a good convention to save the file with the
name of the class. So, as per my example, the file will be saved as Sample.java.

Second step is compilation. The name of the Java compiler is javac. The input to the compiler is Java source code which is available in Sample.java.
The output of the compiler is machine independent or platform independent code which is known as bytecode. The file which is generated after compilation
is .class file. As per my example, the bytecode file will be Sample.class.

Last step is execution. The bytecode generated by the compiler will be executed by Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Input to the JVM is bytecode and output is
machine code (0’s and 1’s) which will be executed by the CPU of the local machine.

what is class?
- A class is a blueprint that defines the variables and the methods common to all objects of a certain kind.

What is object?
- A Java object is a member (also called an instance) of a Java class. Each object has an identity, a behavior and a state. The state of an object is
stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display the object's behavior. Objects are created at runtime from templates, which are also
known as classes.

What is the entry point of an application?
- An application entry point identifies a resource that is an access point to an application. Application entry points are used to control users' access
to different versions of an application that is deployed on a platform.

Why main is static?
- The main() method is static so that JVM can invoke it without instantiating the class. This also saves the unnecessary wastage of memory which would
have been used by the object declared only for calling the main() method by the JVM.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
- Object class is the root or superclass of the class hierarchy, which is present in java. lang package. All predefined classes and user-defined classes
are the subclasses from Object class.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
- The path points to the location of the jre i.e. the java binary files such as the jvm and necessary libraries. The classpath points to the classes you
developed so that the jvm can find them and load them when you run your product.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
- An abstract class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override. An interface only allows you to define functionality,
not implement it.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
- No I can not. Because it's abstract and an object is concrete. An abstract class is sort of like a template, or an empty/partially empty structure,
I have to extend it and build on it before I can use it.

what is Access Specifier?
- Java provides entities called “Access Modifiers or access specifiers” that help us to restrict the scope or visibility of a package, class, constructor,
methods, variables, or other data members. These access modifiers are also called “Visibility Specifiers”.


What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
- OOps in java is to improve code readability and reusability by defining a Java program efficiently. The main principles of object-oriented programming
are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that "shows" only essential attributes and "hides" unnecessary information. The main purpose
of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users.

Encapsulation is one of the key features of object-oriented programming. Encapsulation refers to the bundling of fields and methods inside a single class.
It prevents outer classes from accessing and changing fields and methods of a class. This also helps to achieve data hiding.

Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. The class whose properties and methods are
inherited is known as the Parent class.

Polymorphism is one of the OOPs feature that allows us to perform a single action in different ways.


What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
- A java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages.
In every java class, java. lang is imported by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
- An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of functions that allows applications to access data and interact with external software components,
operating systems, or microservices. To simplify, an API delivers a user response to a system and sends the system's response back to a user.

Google Maps API,Twitter API etc.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
- No.The reason behind this is to prevent ambiguity.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
- If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.
Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters


Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
- An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.

- The try-catch is the simplest method of handling exceptions. Put the code you want to run in the try block, and any Java exceptions
that the code throws are caught by one or more catch blocks.This method will catch any type of Java exceptions that get thrown.
This is the simplest mechanism for handling exceptions.


What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
- Static key word is to makes ur attribute a part of a class (belong to a class).
The static keyword in Java is mainly used for memory management. The static keyword in Java is used to share the same variable or method
of a given class. The users can apply static keywords with variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes. The static keyword belongs to
the class than an instance of the class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
- Java final keyword is a non-access specifier that is used to restrict a class, variable, and method. If we initialize a variable with
the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value. If we declare a method as final, then it cannot be overridden by any subclasses.

What is final, finally and finalize?
- Final is a keyword and is used as access modifier in Java.
- Finally is a block in Java used for Exception Handling.
- Finalize is a method in Java used for Garbage Collection. Application.

What is a constructor ?
- A block of code similar to method used to initialize the object.
   Implicitly call the code during the use of the object.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
- Yes, we can have multiple constructor in a class.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
- The default constructor is called automatically.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
- this key word gave reference to global variable.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
- Super keyword gave reference to super class (parent class)
         We use it to access the superclass from the subclass class.

What is compile time and run time?
- Compile time is the period when the programming code (such as C#, Java, C, Python) is converted to the machine code
 (i.e. binary code).
 - Runtime is the period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.

- String is immutable whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes.

What is Singleton class?
- In Java, Singleton is a design pattern that ensures that a class can only have one object.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
-Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file.

-Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.

when to use transient variable in java?
-Transient in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be part of the serialization process.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
-While loop checks the condition first and then executes the statement(s), whereas do while loop will execute the statement(s) at least once, then the condition is checked.

What is Enum?
-An enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants.

What is Iterator?
- An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
- Integer will take more memory.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
- The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
-Constructor Chaining is the process of calling one constructor of a class from another
     constructor of the same class or another class using the current object of the class.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
- serial garbage collector uses a single thread for garbage collection process
      while the parallel garbage collector uses multiple threads for the garbage collection.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
-No.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
- The stack is a linear data structure that is used to store the collection of objects.
- The Java heap is the area of memory used to store objects instantiated by applications running on the JVM.
